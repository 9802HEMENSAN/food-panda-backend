## **Project: "Zomato Chronicles: The Great Food Fiasco" - Angular Frontend**

Having developed the backend using Flask and Python, your next task is to create a comprehensive and interactive frontend using Angular for "Zesty Zomato", a restaurant in Mumbai. This web application will ensure efficient management and seamless delivery of Zesty Zomato's food services.

### **Key Features:**

1. **Menu Mastery Interface**: Design an intuitive Angular interface for managing the menu. The interface should allow staff to add, update, remove, and view dishes. Incorporate form validation and error handling features to ensure a smooth user experience.
2. **User Interaction Interface**: Implement interactive web pages, forms, or modal dialogs that allow staff to:
    - Add a new dish to the menu.
    - Remove a dish no longer served.
    - Update the availability of a dish.
    - Take a new order from a customer.
    - Update the status of an order.
    - Review all orders.
    - Exit the system.
3. **Order Form Interface**: Design an Angular form to handle orders. The form should allow customers to input their names and chosen dish IDs. Implement JavaScript-based validation to check the availability of dishes and process orders accordingly.
4. **Order Status Update Interface**: Create an interface that enables staff to update order statuses. The interface should allow staff to input an order ID and the new status.
5. **Real-time Order Status Updates Interface**: Implement an Angular service that leverages WebSockets to facilitate real-time updates on order statuses without requiring page refreshes.
6. **Chatbot Assistance Interface**: Implement a chatbot interface that can answer common customer queries.
7. **Customer Feedback System Interface**: Design a user-friendly interface that enables customers to rate and review their orders. These reviews should be displayed on the menu page next to each dish.

### **Extra Adventures:**

1. **Price Calculation Interface**: Implement a dynamic feature on the order review page that calculates and displays the total price of each order.
2. **Status Filter**: Implement a filter feature that allows staff to view orders based on their status.
3. **Data Persistence**: Develop features that save and load menu and order data, ensuring data persistence across multiple usages.

### **Ensure the following points during implementation :**

1. **Functionality**: Ensure the Angular application is functional, meets all requirements, and interacts with the Flask backend effectively.
2. **Design and Usability**: The user interface should be intuitive, user-friendly, and aesthetically pleasing.
3. **Code Style**: The code should be well-structured and easy to read. Make effective use of Angular's component-based architecture.
4. **Robustness**: The application should handle unexpected or invalid user input gracefully. This involves implementing comprehensive form validation and error handling features.
5. **Responsiveness**: The Angular application should adapt well to different screen sizes and devices, providing an optimal user experience on all platforms.

Your expertise in Angular will ensure Zesty Zomato's digital services are a cut above the rest. Good luck!
